    	<h2>Hello, my name is Samlau Kutana!</h2>
    	<p>I'm a recent graduate from McGill University with a BA in Psychology and minors in Computer Science and Behavioral Science. Experience in cognitive psychology and human motivation, with strong organizational, analytical and problem solving skills, as well as a background in coding. I am eager to apply the skills I am passionate about to help a company grow.
    	</p>
    	<p>As an inquisitive teen, I found scientific research into the human brain to be extremely fascinating, piquing my interests in biology, technology, philosophy, and spirituality all at once. My keen interest in unmasking the mysteries of the mind is what led me to study Psychology and Behavioral Science as two of my areas of focus.
    	</p>
    	<p>In my time at McGill I took advantages of opportunities to learn about all kinds of research, by volunteering at labs, attending expositions, and participating in countless studies as a subject.
    	</p>
    	<p>My love for technology and specifically game design led me to dedicate my last minor slot, as well as a significant amount of free time to learning about computer programming. I've never been much of an artist, so after leaving my high school band behind to pursue university, I needed another creative outlet. It took a lot of work, but eventually I gained the skills necessary to express myself with code, creating games, designs, and other projects that I have been able to share with others, using JavaScript, HTML, and other tools.
